Nymology seeks deeper meaning in language and between ourselves. By acquiring commonsense knowledge from people across disciplines, regions and cultures, we can approach a singularity of meaning and understanding.

Nymology invites the collection and analysis of idea sets – a set of dimensions used to frame a concept. The resulting “thesaurus” can be used to populate knowledgebase systems for natural language processing.

The code here powers a Django/PostgreSQL website Nymology, where users can participate in activities involving story templates, idea sets and other meaning structures:
